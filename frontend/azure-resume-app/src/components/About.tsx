        One of my most rewarding projects was developing a web application that provides users with an in-depth look at their Spotify music listening history. This project utilized Express, Node.js, JavaScript, and MongoDB, utilized OAuth 2.0 protocol to ensure secure user authorization. The experience not only expanded my technical knowledge but also allowed me to collaborate closely with a talented team, reinforcing my belief in the power of teamwork.
